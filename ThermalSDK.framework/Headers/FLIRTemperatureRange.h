 * This means that reading the 'selectedIndex' will return the old value for a short while, until the camera sets everything up internally.
 * It is up to the developer to subscribe if it is required.
 * When 'selectedIndex' is being set on the FLIR ONE camera, in order to properly reflect new value in 'image.CameraInformation'
 * the streaming must be started prior to setting the value and also 'FLIRThermalImage.getImage()' needs to be called.
