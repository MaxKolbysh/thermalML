/**
 *  The FLIRDisplaySettings exposes a range of visual attributes which specify how the image is
 *  displayed. They also specify how image was displayed when it was initially taken by a camera.
 *  FLIRDisplaySettings allows user to specify a "subsection" of interest, while still keeping the
 *  entire image available for context.
 *  For example: taking an image of a car engine, but "zoom-in" to a faulty spark-plug, while keeping
 *  the entire image of the photographed engine for a context.
 *  The FLIRDisplaySettings effects both the IR and visual image.
