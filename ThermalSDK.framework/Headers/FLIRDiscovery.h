/**
 Discover cameras on your connected network. Finds a FLIR ONE if connected to your device.
 
 @note Cameras can be reported as found even if they aren't connectable, depending on the implementation (entries could be cached in system services).
       Similarly camera lost events might be delayed, depending on the implementation (some implementations are only refreshed once per 5 minutes).
       One should use `FLIRCamera.connect(...)` if faster feedback is required.

 ### Example Usage
 ```swift
 import UIKit
 import ThermalSDK
 
 class ViewController: UIViewController, FLIRDiscoveryEventDelegate {
 
    // Create a discovery object.
    let discoverer = FLIRDiscovery()

    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        // Set the discovere delegate to self.
        discoverer.delegate = self
        // Start discovery on all supported interfaces.
        discoverer.start(FLIRCommunicationInterface.FLIRCommunicationInterfaceLightning)
    }
 
    func cameraFound(_ cameraIdentity: FLIRIdentity) {
        // Handle discovered camera identity object...
    }
 
    // Etc ...
 }
 ```
